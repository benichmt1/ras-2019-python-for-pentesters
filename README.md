* Install `pipenv` using your package manager
* Install packages with `pipenv install --dev`
    * The `--dev` flag will install additional, helpful packages for development

## Lab Files
Lab files are in the form of incomplete Python scripts. Take a look at the
description, and apply the listed core-concepts to complete the objective.

### Hard Mode
Both labs include a series of "Hard Mode" challenges. These challenges are
available should you finish early or want suggestions for self-study at a later
time. They are numbered in ascending order of complexity.
