# RSM
# 2019 RAS Conference - Python for Pentesters Labs

## Installation
* Python 3.6+ is required
* Install `pipenv` using your package manager
* Install packages with `pipenv install --dev`
    * The `--dev` flag will install additional, helpful packages for development

Use [AWS Cloud9][1] if you are unable to use Python on your local system.

## Lab Files
Lab files are in the form of incomplete Python scripts. Take a look at the
description, and apply the listed core-concepts to complete the objective.

Areas which require completion are marked with `todo: ` and a note on what needs
to be done. Without modification, the scripts are non-functioning due to syntax
errors.

### Difficulty Levels
Each lab comes in three levels of difficulty.

**Easy** -- Only small sections of code are removed, often surrounded by context
    to get you started.

**Normal** -- Larger sections of code are removed. You're expected to
    demonstrate knowledge of the core concepts to complete them from scratch.

**Hard** -- The entire main method of the script has been removed. You must
    write your own implementation. The necessary libraries have been imported
    for you.

### Bonus Challenges
Both labs include a series of "Bonus" challenges. These challenges are available
should you finish early or want suggestions for self-study at a later time. They
are numbered in ascending order of complexity.
